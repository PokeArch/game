# Assets

The `Assets` folder in PokeArch contains various assets used in the game, organized into subfolders for easy management. These assets include tilesets for map creation, cutscenes for storytelling, character sprites, and UI components for the game interface.

## Subfolders

### Tilesets

The `Tilesets` subfolder contains tileset images used to create the game's maps and environments. These tilesets are used in the Godot Engine's tilemap system to build the game world and define terrain, obstacles, and other map elements.

### Cutscenes

The `Cutscenes` subfolder contains videos, images, or scripts used to create cutscenes in the game. These cutscenes are used to advance the game's storyline, provide context for gameplay events, and enhance the game's narrative.

### Characters

The `Characters` subfolder contains sprites and animations for the game's characters. These sprites are used to represent playable characters, NPCs, enemies, and other entities in the game world. Each character sprite typically includes multiple frames for animation, such as walking, running, and interacting.

### UI Components

The `UI Components` subfolder contains assets used to create the game's user interface. This includes images for buttons, menus, health bars, icons, and other UI elements. These assets are used to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface for players to interact with the game.

## Usage

To use these assets in your Godot project, simply place them in the corresponding subfolders of the `Assets` folder. You can then import them into your scenes and scripts as needed. Godot's resource system allows you to easily reference these assets and use them to create your game's visuals and interactions.

By organizing assets into subfolders, PokeArch maintains a structured and efficient asset management system, making it easier to locate, use, and update assets throughout the development process.
